# Data Reduction Network (DRN)

* Example Contents:
  * DRNSolarFlaresDemo.ipynb - Demonstration Notebook
    * This notebook demonstrates the fundamental process of transforming categorical data into a DRN. For this demonstration, we've chosen to use the libraries networkx and pyvis. However, the methodology is not exclusive to these libraries; any graph visualization algorithm can be employed

## Library Project:

Currently, the technique involves an ad hoc combination of graph manipulation using `networkx`, coupled with `pyvis` for visualization. As the technique matures, including improvements in data handling, we aim to evolve this into a comprehensive package.
